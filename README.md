# 🏡 House Price Prediction (Machine Learning Project)

This project predicts house prices using Machine Learning models.  
It uses data preprocessing, feature engineering, and multiple regression algorithms to generate accurate price predictions.


This project includes:
- Data cleaning & preprocessing  
- Handling missing values  
- Feature engineering  
- Encoding categorical variables  
- Training multiple ML models  
- Model evaluation  
- Saving best model  
- Optional: Streamlit app for prediction interface



## 🛠️ **Technologies Used**
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-Learn  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn    


## 📂 **Project Files**
- `house_price_prediction.py` — Main Model Training Script  
- `train.csv` — Dataset  
- `models/` — Saved models  
- `images/` — Graphs & screenshots (optional)  
- `app.py` — Streamlit app (optional)



## 📊 **Model Evaluation Metrics**
The models are evaluated using:
- RMSE  
- MAE  
- R² Score  
- MAPE  



## 🚀 **How to Run**

### 1️⃣ Install required libraries:


### 2️⃣ Run the model script:


### 3️⃣ Run Streamlit App:


## 📈 **Features Engineered**
- House Age  
- Years Since Remodel  
- Total Bathrooms  
- Total Sqft  
- Price per Sqft  
- Neighborhood grouping  



## 🎯 **Project Goal**
To build a machine learning system that predicts house prices accurately and can be deployed as a real-world application.
